1) Create classes for visualization.
  Possibilities:
    Vectors with color to represent pressure and length to represent velocity.
    Streamlines
    Particles (with streaks and color)
  Test uniform stream before starting on potential flow.
  Ensure 60fps
2) Create a structure for different types of simulation (potential flow, numeric simulation). Should be as simple as pairing a simulation method with a compatible visualization method.
3) Visualize potential flow. Shouldn't require any real time simulation, but will need to be animated nevertheless.
  Superposition means that solutions to the equations can be overlaid.
    Still need a way of finding the equipotential contours.
  Rankine's half-oval
4) Study numeric methods for Euler's equation.
5) Implement Euler's equation with real time simulation (GPU compute?).
  Run at different time step and time scale

  Control methods
    Initial conditions
    Place a fire (heat source) in the scene
      p = ρRT (assume ρ constant?) ⟹ p↑ for T↑ ⟹ sufficient to have a region of increased p.
  Walls
6) Find a way to "incidentally" display text.
  Let random spawns have the same seed, and keep track of which number a particle in the desired region at a given time has. Change the color of this particle at spawn time.
  Method
    Create a bit representation of image text, with bits being on/off representing text/no text.
    For every particle at a time t, check if its relative position is in an enabled bit or not.
7) Look into Navier-Stokes equation.
